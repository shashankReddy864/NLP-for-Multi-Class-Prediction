# NLP-for-Multi-Class-Prediction

**Business Objective**

Natural Language Processing, often abbreviated as NLP, gives the ability to machines to understand, read, and get meaningful insights from human language. We deal logistic Regression as a baseline model with binary classification. But this project aims to give us an overview of text classification where there are more than two classes available and we try to build a classification model on processed data using the Naive Bayes algorithm. This project explaines about the Natural Language processing flow and implementation of Naive Bayes Algorithm for Multi Class Labels.


**Aim**

To Preproces the Dataset and build a multiclass classification model.



**Data Description**

The dataset contains more than two million customer complaints about consumer financial products. Amongst the various available columns, we have a column that contains the actual text of the complaint and one column containing the product for which the customer is raising the complaint.
